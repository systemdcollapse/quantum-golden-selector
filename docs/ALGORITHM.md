# 🧮 Quantum Golden Selector – Reverse Engineering Documentation

This documentation describes the Quantum Golden Selector quantum algorithm through a reverse engineering approach. Starting from the final state of the quantum prototype, the logical flow is reconstructed backward to the initial inputs.

## 📐 Final Result: Optimal Approximation of the Golden Ratio (φ)

The algorithm’s final output identifies the value that best approximates the golden ratio:

```
apex ≈ reference × φ
```

### 4. Final Quantum Result

The output is produced by post-processing quantum measurements, selecting the best candidate among possible results obtained by the quantum computation.

### 3. Internal Quantum Process

The final quantum process involves the repeated application of two fundamental operators:

* **Diffusion Operator**: Reflects the quantum state about the mean.
* **Oracle Operator**: Marks optimal candidate states (with minimum deviation from φ).

These operators cyclically amplify the amplitude of optimal states.

### 2. Quantum Encoding of Candidates

Before the diffusion and oracle phases, a quantum encoding maps each potential candidate to a quantum binary state (represented on ⌈log₂(N)⌉ qubits).

### 1. Candidate Generation (Original Input)

Initial candidates are generated based on the theoretical value:

```
golden_apex_exact = reference × φ
```

These candidates form the original input from which the process begins.

## 📊 Retrospective Performance Evaluation

During reverse engineering, the following are also evaluated:

* **Accuracy** compared to the theoretical value.
* **Quantum Advantage** over classical approaches.
* **Circuit Efficiency**.

## 🧩 Main Components (Retrospective View)

The key components emerging retrospectively as critical to the prototype’s functioning:

* **Quantum Post-Processing**: Selecting the best result based on a combined scoring metric.
* **Intelligent Candidate Generation**: Targeted creation of candidates near the theoretical golden value.
* **Dynamic Parameter Optimization**: Circuit calibration to meet hardware constraints.

## ⚙️ Hardware-Specific Adaptations

Reverse engineering highlights optimizations made for compatibility with specific quantum platforms, identifying strategies to mitigate noise and hardware limitations.

## 🔮 Potential Future Extensions

By analyzing the prototype backwards, potential improvements and future extensions emerge, such as integrating with QAOA, VQE, or Quantum Machine Learning to further enhance performance.
